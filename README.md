# Slackify

Turns the program argument into a series of slack-emoji letters, leaving punctuation alone and replacing whitespace with `:blank:` emoji. It's up to you to load the "blank" emoji into your Slack workspace:

e.g.

`slackify 'Hello World!'` produces `:alphabet-white-h::alphabet-white-e::alphabet-white-l::alphabet-white-l::alphabet-white-o::blank::alphabet-white-w::alphabet-white-o::alphabet-white-r::alphabet-white-l::alphabet-white-d:!`

You can copy-paste the output into a slack message and your message will become a lot more exciting:
